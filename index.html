          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            I've been a web developer for two years, mainly using the .NET Stack and Microsoft SQL Server for my professional activities. 
            I also know my way around Python and use it for automation, prototyping and developing cloud-based solutions.
            I'm always trying to learn new things and keep up with the latest technology to design and develop better web-based solutions.

          <h3>Cloud Deployment</h3>
          <p>
            As an AWS-certified Solution Architect, I have a strong foundation in cloud deployments. 
            I'm well-versed in AWS services and currently learning how to deploy simple and complex cloud architectures using Terraform. 
            My approach to the Cloud is to strive for the most efficient, effective and automated solution to deploy.

          <h3>Gym Hitter</h3>
          <p>
            I'm quite an active person, and I enjoy staying in shape. 
            I regularly hit the gym and practise many sports like badminton, swimming, and bouldering. 
            I also love hiking and can spend hours exploring the great outdoors. 
            Whether it's a challenging mountain trail or a peaceful nature walk, I love to experience the beauty and wonder of nature.

          <h3>Carbo King</h3>
          <p>
            I have a great love for cooking, particularly when making fresh pasta and pizza. 
            I enjoy experimenting with different techniques and methods for creating unique and flavorful pasta dishes, from coloured pasta to stuffed varieties. 
            There's something satisfying about crafting a delicious meal from scratch, and I take great pride in what I create.
